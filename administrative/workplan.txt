Work Plan for Sgr B2 ALMA Mosaic analysis

REDUCTION:
Adam Ginsburg, Fanyi Meng?

PLAN: Combine 7m and 12m data
1. Set calibration weights correctly


Bubbles & Feedback:
GOALS: Identify the bubbles, their driving sources, and their energy content.
Determine what was needed to drive them and their likely effects on the "cloud"
Adam Ginsburg et al


Turbulence:

GOALS: Measure turbulent power spectrum, size-linewidth relation.  Determine if
       Sgr B2 is consistent with CMZ.

PLAN: 
1. Use many different lines to perform VCA, VCS analysis.
1b. Use combined map of many lines for VCA/VCS?
2. Dendrogram the cube for size-linewidth relation

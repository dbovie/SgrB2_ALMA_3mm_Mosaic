Sgr B2 TC calibration
---------------------
The original calibration was done with the pipeline.  I (think) I re-did it
with manual calibration to avoid the flagging from the pipeline, which flagged
out the entire HCN, HCO+, and HNC lines.  The uid*scriptForCalibration.py
scripts were therefore not included in the archive.

The script "manual_reduction.py" was used to produce the scripts...

-Could the point sources be externally photoionized proplyds?

  - Maybe: their fluxes are consistent, and the upper limits from the 1cm emission don't rule it out
  - No: if they're photoionized, the gas around them should be too, but there is no free-free emission around them


Title: A catalog of 3mm point sources in the Sgr B2 cloud: signs of extended star formation in a CMZ cloud

We report the detection of >100 sources in the Sgr B2 clouds with extents smaller than 5000 AU.  These
sources are most likely to be protostars or centrally condensed prestellar cores.  The spatial extent
of these sources demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing a highly extended star formation event, not
just an isolated `starburst' within the protocluster regions M, N, and S.
